# coal.labour.nexus

## Overview
> The coal.labour.nexus is a standalone module to analyse the labour implications of IAM pathways. 
> The module downscales pathways across regions of China and India to determine the ability of coal mining workers to find new employment. 
> It was originally developed as an ex-post module for Imaclim-R World V2.0. It can be used with any transition scenario using the IIASA format. Filler scenarios can be provided if pathways miss crucial variables.

## Disclaimer
The module is still in development.
