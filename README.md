# coal.labour.nexus

## Overview
> The coal.labour.nexus is a standalone module to analyse the labour implications of IAM pathways. 
> The module downscales pathways across regions of China and India to determine the ability of coal mining workers to find new employment. 
> It was originally developed as an ex-post module for Imaclim-R World V2.0. It can be used with any transition scenario. Filler scenarios can be provided if pathways miss crucial variables.

## Disclaimer
The module is still in development.


## Using the module
### Data and preprocessing
Input data for the coal labour nexus is not made available here as it contains data which cannot be shared freely. Two sorts of input data is required to run the module:
1) National demographic scenario data
2) Subnational downscaling data

The data is processed by running `coal.labour.nexus\data\process_data.sh` which calls `Building_age_pyramid.py` and `Process_waysout_data.py` which treat each type of data respectively.

For default scenarios, demographic data are based on the 2015 UN age pyramid data[^1] and demographic projections from SSP scenario data[^2]. The user is free to use demographic projections consistent with the analysed scenario.

Other data are stored in a `Database.csv` file with the following format:

| Country | Region | Type | Year | Value | Unit | Source | URL | Note |
|---------|--------|------|------|-------|------|--------|-----|------|


### Input scenarios
Input scenarios must first be placed in the `coal.labour.nexus\input\` folder. The module is designed to read scenario results presented following the IAMC time-series data template[^3]. The code is designed to read each scenario from an independent csv file.

If some required variables is missing from the scenario data, it can be infilled with Imaclim-R World V2.0 results for typical scenario in `coal.labour.nexus\Infilling_trajectories` 

### Defining module scenarios
The scenarios are defined and the model is ran from `coal.labour.nexus\model`.

The module is designed to perform different sensitivity analysis base on original *ex ante* scenarios (input scenarios). For a given input scenario, there can be several *output* scenarios. Those scenarios are defined in `V2_batch.labour.sce`. 
For each scenario, the user must define a source (i.e. the *input scenario*). They can then define a number of additional parameters:
- Retirement age
- Coal labour productivity growth
- Source of downscaling data
- Structural change parameter (no structural change by default)
- How to consider competition for available job vacancies.
- Whether to create infilling trajectories

### Running the module
The module can be run through `coal.labour.nexus.sce\model\run.sh` or `V2_batch.labour.sce` directly. The code loops through each scenario and calls `V2_nexus.labour.core.sce`.

For each step, the core of the module fetches demographic and geographical downscaling keys. It then calculates non-coal trajectories. 

For Imaclim-R World V2.0, these are found in `Imaclim.Labour.sce` by attributing labour from each of the 11 non-coal sectors to the subnational regions before reaggregating. 

Coal labour is then found from coal production and productivity increase in `V2_coal.productivity.sce`


### Outputs
For each run results are saved alongside log files in a folder in `coal.labour.nexus\output`. A csv file is created for each scenario in a format analogous to the IAMC's. 


### Plots
The `notebooks` folder contains code to plot useful figures. `Plots_main.py` contains the code for figures used for the paper *Regional employment vulnerability to rapid coal transition in China and India, an integrated and downscaled assessment* (unpublished).
